### Common Wiring Issues FAQ

1. **After flashing the firmware, the RGB light does not turn on**  
   - Please check whether the solder joints around the RGB light are properly soldered. If there are any unsoldered places, you can first use wires to connect the corresponding pads and check if the light functions normally after restarting.

2. **How to check for circuit faults?**
- **When not powered**: You can use a multimeter to measure continuity between wires and GND or 3.3V pins to check for short or open circuits.  
   - **When powered**: Measure the voltage values between GND and other pins to see if they are within normal ranges (e.g., 5V, 3.3V); if abnormal, further check the corresponding module and connections.

3. **What to do when contact problems frequently occur when using the breadboard?**  
   - This may be due to aging breadboard sockets or oxidation of component pins. You can try replacing the breadboard, cleaning the component pins, or using shorter jumper wires to reduce points of failure.

4. **How to connect the grounds of sensors, power modules, etc.?**  
   - The ground of external modules should be connected to the GND of the main control board, ensuring they all share the same ground line to avoid noise or signal stability issues.

> **Tip**: If you encounter troubleshooting that is difficult to locate, consider checking if the power supply is stable (e.g., 5V or 3.3V) and ensure that the firmware version and sample code correspond to the actual wiring.

5. **Start Flashing**: Click `START`. The progress bar will begin running until a successful **FINISH** prompt appears. This entire process typically takes a few minutes to over ten minutes, depending on the firmware size and speed settings.

### Flashing Complete

Once the flashing is complete, press the `RST (Restart)` button on the development board (shown in the diagram below) to restart the board, allowing it to enter **Wi-Fi configuration mode**. Configuration operations are detailed in the subsequent instructions.

## How to Configure Device Wi-Fi

### 1. Wi-Fi Network Configuration

#### 1) Start the Device
- After flashing the firmware, keep the device powered on and press the **RST** button (shown in the diagram below) to restart, which will put the device in configuration mode.  
![Img](media/img-20250409155600.png)

#### 2) Configuration Status
- **sRGB Color Light Blinking Blue**: Indicates that it is in configuration mode.  
- **sRGB Color Light Not On**: See section 2 of this page for details.  
- If the device is not in configuration mode or needs to be reconfigured, press and hold the **configuration button (connected to GPIO 1)**, then press the **RST** button to reset; first, release RST, then release the configuration button to re-enter configuration mode.  
- For firmware versions ≥0.2.2, if three attempts to connect to the original Wi-Fi fail, it will automatically revert to configuration mode (you can press RST to restart the device when switching networks).

#### 3) Configuration Steps
1. **Connect to "Xiao Zhi" Wi-Fi**  
   Use your phone or computer to connect to the Wi-Fi emitted by the device (the name typically resembles *Xiaozhi-XXXXXX*).

2. **Configure the Network**  
   Click on the found Wi-Fi name *Xiaozhi-XXXXXX* to connect, which will automatically redirect to the configuration page:
  
![Img](media/img-20250419112718.png)

   > - Select 2.4G Wi-Fi (if using an iPhone hotspot, you need to enable “maximum compatibility”).  
   > - Input the password, then click **Connect**.  
   > - If successfully connected, the interface will display “Done” and automatically restart after 3 seconds.

If automatic redirection to the configuration page does not occur, you can also manually enter `http://192.168.4.1` in the browser's address bar to access the configuration page.

### 2. About the RGB Color Light on the Device

1. **Connection and Update Status**  
   - When powered on, if the blue light blinks once, the device is connecting to Wi-Fi; if the **green light blinks afterward**, it indicates a successful connection and that the device can be awakened by voice.  
   - If the blue light stays on: the device is performing OTA firmware updates, which usually complete in under a minute.  
   - If the blue light keeps blinking: the device is in configuration mode.  
   - If the blue light turns on during voice awakening: it indicates that it is connecting to the server.  
   - If the green light is on: the device is playing audio.  
   - If the red light is on: the device is recording audio.

2. **RGB Light Not Turning On**  
   - If the light switch has not been soldered, it will not affect Wi-Fi configuration but will prevent you from checking the device status.

### 3. How to Add a Device

1. **Confirm Device Is Online**  
   - Once the device connects to the network, it will announce a 6-digit verification code (which can be retrieved by awakening it again).

2. **Access Control Panel**  
   - Open the [Xiaozhi AI Chatbot - Control Panel](https://xiaozhi.me/) by entering [https://xiaozhi.me](https://xiaozhi.me) in your browser (if you don’t have an account, you may register). Click on the top right corner to switch to your preferred language.

3. **Device Management**  
   - Create an agent,
    ![Img](media/img-20250419140216.png)

   - Set your agent's name.  
   ![Img](media/img-20250419140936.png)

   - Click “Add New Device”.  
   
   ![Img](media/img-20250419141027.png)  
   Enter the 6-digit **Device ID**.  

   ![Img](media/img-20250419141114.png)  

   **Where to obtain the Device ID**: After successful firmware upload and network configuration, the device will automatically announce the six-digit code.

4. **Activation Successful**  
   - The device will automatically activate and display on the “Device Management” page. Click **Configure Role** to enter the configuration interface.  
   ![Img](media/img-20250419141632.png)

   - Configure the assistant's name and voice. In the Role Introduction section, you can use AI tools to write a description of the character you desire.  
   ![Img](media/img-20250419142018.png)

   - Configure AI big models, which allow several optional settings. After determining the settings, save them.
